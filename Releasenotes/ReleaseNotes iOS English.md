## 3.1.2 

In version 3.0, syncing was not as stable as expected. Therefore syncing was replaced by a better solution.
Sorry that it took this long.

Please note: Syncing needs to be re-initialized when updating from 3.0. This may take some minutes. But it’s worth the wait, really.

New in 3.1.2:
- Improved sync stability
- Fixed next revision calculation
- Added sync status display
- Fixed reordering of chapters/lessons
- Fixed audio playback in tests
- Fixed update of list when adding books
- All crashes found in 3.1 are fixed

New in 3.1:
- New, enhanced syncing technology
- Many crashes have been fixed
- Much better performance, especially when working with many words or audio recordings
- User interface enhancements

Thanks for all reported bugs and enhancement requests! Please keep them coming at support@chbeer.de... I will be working on them next, as syncing now should work as expected.
